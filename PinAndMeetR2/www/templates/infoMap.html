<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>The Ionic Popup service allows programmatically creating and showing popup windows that require the user to respond in order to continue.</p>
<p>The popup system has support for more flexible versions of the built in alert(), prompt(), and confirm() functions that users are used to, in addition to allowing popups with completely custom content and look.</p>
<p>An input can be given an autofocus attribute so it automatically receives focus when the popup first shows. However, depending on certain use-cases this can cause issues with the tap/click system, which is why Ionic prefers using the autofocus attribute as an opt-in feature and not the default</p>
