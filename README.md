This version is for VS2017 but can be opened to newer version.

Before opening the code, make sure you have installed
- Latest versions of NPM, Node and Git
- Latest version of Android SDK
- Latest version of JDK (SE)
- Cordova using VS Installation

Also a MAC is needed to complile iOS version
- Install latest version of Xcode and admin console

I recommed firts making a test project (Hello World) from VS menu and install it to a Android device, just to check that everything runs OK.

I recommend using Google Ripple as an emulator. Very fast compared to using MS default emulator.

This source code may refer to old plug-in versions. It's recommeded to update all to latest versions.

Actual code in under www-folder.

First. Find in files string: [Input here] and set your tokens and passwords.

Good luck!
